A list of selected papers to better illustrate my research activity and my major achievements (in inverse chronological order)

* T. Baker, E. Bellini, P. G. Ferreira, M. Lagos, J. Noller, and I. Sawicki, “*Strong constraints on cosmological gravity from GW170817 and GRB 170817A*”, [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119 no. 25, (2017) 251301](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251301), [arXiv:1710.06394](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06394): This paper is receiving a huge attention from the community. We have been selected as “PRL Editor’s suggestion”. Indeed, it is the first paper that points out the profound implications that the detection of the gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger has on Modified Gravity theories.

* E. Bellini et al., “*Comparison of Einstein-Boltzmann solvers for testing general relativity*”, [Phys. Rev. D97 no. 2, (2018) 023520](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.97.023520), [arXiv:1709.09135](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09135): This paper compares Einstein-Boltzmann solvers that include modifications to general relativity. The main objective was to validate and tune these tools with the accuracy requested by the next generation of surveys.

* M. Zumalacárregui, E. Bellini, I. Sawicki, J. Lesgourgues, and P. G. Ferreira, “*hi_class: Horndeski in the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System*”, [JCAP 1708 no. 08, (2017) 019](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/08/019), [arXiv:1605.06102](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06102): This paper comes with the publication of one of the reference Einstein-Boltzmann solvers in the community, i.e. hi_class. hi_class is a modification of the publicly available CLASS to include general Dark Energy and Modified Gravity models.

* E. Bellini, A. J. Cuesta, R. Jimenez, and L. Verde, “*Constraints on deviations from ΛCDM within Horndeski gravity*”, [JCAP 1602 no. 02, (2016) 053](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2016/02/053), [arXiv:1509.07816](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07816): This is a reference point since it is the first paper where constraints on the general Horndeski scalar-tensor theories are provided. We used a collection of current data and impose significant restrictions on the parameter space of these theories.

* E. Bellini, R. Jimenez, and L. Verde, “*Signatures of Horndeski gravity on the Dark Matter Bispectrum*”, [JCAP 1505 no. 05, (2015) 057](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2015/05/057), [arXiv:1504.04341](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04341): We analyzed the impact of Modified Gravity theories on the matter bispectrum generated at late times by gravitational instability. Our main conclusion is that the observation of large deviations in the bispectrum would be reflected in huge deviations on the linear power spectrum.

* E. Bellini and I. Sawicki, “*Maximal freedom at minimum cost: linear large-scale structure in general modifications of gravity*”, [JCAP 1407 (2014) 050](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2014/07/050), [arXiv:1404.3713](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3713): This paper introduces what is now considered the standard framework to model Dark Energy and Modified Gravity theories (“α functions”), used also by large collaborations as Planck and Euclid.
