###### Welcome to my homepage!  

I am an astrophysicist, currently holding a Beecroft fellowship at the [University of Oxford](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/) and a junior research fellowship at [Queen's College](https://www.queens.ox.ac.uk/), Oxford, UK. After completing my Ph.D. at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/), Italy, I spent some time visiting the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?lang=e), [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), Germany. I have also been a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Cosmo Sciences](http://icc.ub.edu/), [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/index.html?), Spain.

My research activity is mainly devoted to the study of the laws of gravity at the largest measurable scales of the universe. The aim is to test the robustness of General Relativity - our standard theory of gravity - up to cosmological scales, in yet unexplored regimes. This gives us hints on the observed accelerated expansion of the universe, the nature of gravity and its connection with fundamental physics. My focus is both on the theory side and on the comparison with data. I have also worked on other topics such as Black Hole physics, Gravitational Waves and their implication in alternative theories of gravity and neutrino physics in cosmology.
